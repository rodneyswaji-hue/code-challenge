## Description
This project contains solutions to three JavaScript toy problems:
1. **Student Grade Generator** – calculates a grade based on marks.
2. **Speed Detector** – calculates demerit points based on car speed.
3. **Net Salary Calculator** – computes net salary from basic salary and benefits.

Each solution runs directly in the **browser** using `prompt()` and `alert()`.
